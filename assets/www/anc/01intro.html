					In this study session you will learn about the status of maternal
					and newborn mortality worldwide, in Africa as a whole, and in
					Ethiopia specifically, so you can understand the extent of the
					problems that need to be addressed through improved maternal and
					newborn health services. <b>Antenatal care</b>, the professional
					healthcare a woman receives throughout her pregnancy, is important
					in helping to ensure that women and newborn babies survive
					pregnancy and childbirth. We show you how to plan the antenatal
					care services that your community needs in order to improve and
					protect the health of mothers and newborns during pregnancy,
					childbirth and the postnatal period. You will learn what is meant
					by the antenatal profile of your community, and how to calculate
					the number of mothers who are pregnant every year in your catchment
					area. They will need antenatal care throughout pregnancy, and your
					expert support during labour, delivery and the postnatal period.
					You will also be collecting and reporting data on how many
					antenatal visits each woman receives, and what proportion of births
					were attended by a health professional.
