		<p>You will also learn how to educate and engage individuals,
			groups, opinion leaders and community members in the promotion and
			better utilisation of antenatal care services. Exactly the same
			principles apply to promoting the uptake of health services for
			labour and delivery, and postnatal care &#x2014; as you will see in
			the next two Modules. Finally, we show you the steps in planning
			health education activities aimed at reducing maternal and newborn
			mortality by increasing the antenatal care coverage rate. You can
			apply these same steps to health promotion activities with other
			aims, for example increasing the uptake of family planning services.</p>
