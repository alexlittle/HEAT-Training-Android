		<p>In Study Session 2, you have learned that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The main purpose of promoting the utilisation of antenatal
						care is to reduce the number of maternal and newborn deaths and
						complications.</li>
					<li>Antenatal care is an opportunity to promote dialogue with
						clients, to reinforce maternal health messages about danger signs
						during the antenatal, delivery and postnatal periods, and to
						ensure everyone knows where to seek appropriate care.</li>
					<li>Health promotion covers any activities that result in
						better health in a community or a country; it can involve the
						actions of individuals, groups, organisations, institutions and
						governments. Health education, health screening and disease
						prevention all contribute to health promotion activities.</li>
					<li>Health education enables people to increase control over,
						and improve, the health of themselves, their families and their
						communities by their own actions and efforts. It is a continuing
						process, based on planned and organised activities that take
						account of the audience's culture, tradition, language and local
						resources.</li>
					<li>Advocacy and community mobilisation help to gain and
						maintain the involvement of a broad range of individuals, groups
						and sectors at different levels in the community, in achieving the
						desired goal.</li>
					<li>Educating influential opinion leaders, religious leaders,
						husbands and fathers to be advocates and partners in improving
						women's health during pregnancy, labour and delivery, is very
						important.</li>
					<li>Health promotion campaigns, education events, discussion
						groups and communication with individuals should be carefully
						prepared, and use different communication and presentation media
						as appropriate.</li>
					<li>Group discussion is the most commonly used health
						education method. It involves two-way communication, in which
						participants are given an equal chance to express their views
						freely, and exchange their experiences and ideas.</li>
					<li>Individual health education is based on creating trust and
						mutual understanding, enabling frankness between participants, the
						free exchange of ideas, and immediate feedback.</li>
					<li>A good place to start is by listening to your audience.
						When you find out what people already know, you can help them
						build on that knowledge, and when you listen, you will learn from
						those you are educating.</li>
					<li>Provide opportunities to make the antenatal care service
						the community's own programme, by promoting the identification of
						problems and solutions, the planning and implementation of
						positive actions, and the evaluation of outcomes.</li>
