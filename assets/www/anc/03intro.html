			Applied anatomy and physiology for basic obstetric care is an entry
			to your studies in this Module and the next four Modules, and is
			essential preparation for your practical skills training. Obstetric
			care refers to healthcare for women during pregnancy, labour and
			delivery, and their immediate postnatal care. It requires a good
			understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the female
			reproductive system. Anatomy is the study of the <i>structures</i> of
			the human body, i.e. the features of how the organs, tissues and body
			systems are constructed. Physiology, on the other hand, is the study
			of the coordinated <i>functions</i> of the organs, tissues and
			systems in the body.
		</p>
		<p>In this study session, you will learn about the structures that
			make the external female genitalia and the internal reproductive
			organs. In Session 4, we teach you about the hormonal regulation of
			the internal female reproductive organs and the female monthly
			menstrual cycle (bleeding from the vagina). In Study Session 5, we
			describe ovulation, fertilisation and implantation of the embryo in
			the mother's uterus (womb), and the development of the fetus, the
			placenta and fetal nutrition. In Study Session 6, you will learn the
			anatomy of the female bony pelvis, and also of the fetal skull, which
			has to pass through the mother's pelvis during delivery.</p>
