		<p>In Study Session 3, you have learned that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Anatomy is the study of the <i>structures</i> of the human
						body, and physiology is the study of the coordinated <i>functions</i>
						of the organs, tissues and body systems.
					</li>
					<li>The female reproductive system is divided into the
						external genitalia (below and exterior to the vaginal opening),
						and the internal reproductive organs (above the vaginal opening in
						the pelvic cavity).</li>
					<li>The internal reproductive organs are close to the bladder,
						the large intestine and the rectum; the external opening of the
						vagina is close to the urethral opening and the anus. These close
						relationships increase the opportunities for infection to spread
						in the genital area.</li>
					<li>In some traditional societies, the clitoris and labia
						minora are often removed by female genital mutilitation; this can
						have serious (even fatal) consequences for the woman, especially
						during labour and delivery.</li>
					<li>The ovaries are female sex organs which usually produce
						one ovum every month during the reproductive years. One of the
						fallopian tubes carries the ovum from the ovary towards the
						uterus. If fertilisation occurs, it normally happens in the
						fallopian tube.</li>
					<li>The uterus is a muscular organ, which gives mechanical
						protection and nutritional support to the developing fetus during
						pregnancy.</li>
					<li>The female reproductive hormones, oestrogen and
						progesterone, direct the maturation of ova in the ovaries, the
						release of an ovum (ovulation), and the thickening of the
						endometrium (the fatty lining of the uterus). If fertilisation of
						the ovum and pregnancy does not result, the endometrium is shed as
						the menstrual flow.</li>
					<li>The vagina functions as a passageway for elimination of
						the menstrual flow; it receives the penis during sexual
						intercourse; and it forms the lower portion of the birth canal.</li>
