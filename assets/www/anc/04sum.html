		<p>In Study Session 4, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The hormones controlling the female reproductive system
				include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating
				hormone (FSH) and leutenizing hormone (LH), all of which are
				produced in the brain; oestrogen and progesterone produced by the
				ovaries and the corpus luteum; and human chorionic gonadotropin
				(HCG), produced by the placenta during pregnancy.</li>
			<li>The menstrual cycle typically lasts 28 days, but it can be
				highly variable. It is characterised by menstruation from days 1 to
				5 and ovulation at around day 14, but the date of ovulation is
				difficult to predict accurately.</li>
			<li>Menstruation is the monthly shedding from the uterus of the
				endometrium with some blood, which emerges through the vagina,
				typically for a period of three to five days. Menstruation continues
				from menarche to the menopause, except during pregnancy. It may also
				be suppressed by breastfeeding.</li>
			<li>The ovarian cycle refers to the regular, repeating events
				occurring in the ovaries during the menstrual cycle, characterised
				by the development of a few ovarian follicles; the maturation and
				release (ovulation) of a single ovum; and the formation and
				subsequent degeneration of the corpus luteum if pregnancy does not
				occur.</li>
			<li>The uterine cycle refers to the regular, repeating events
				occurring in the uterus during the menstrual cycle, characterised by
				the thickening of the endometrium and an increase in its blood
				supply, followed by its degeneration and shedding as the menstrual
				flow if pregnancy does not occur.</li>
			<li>The menarche and the development of secondary sexual
				characteristics signal the period known as puberty, when the
				internal reproductive organs grow to adult size and a girl becomes
				fertile and capable of becoming pregnant.</li>
