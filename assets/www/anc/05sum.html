		<p>In Study Session 5, you have learned that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fertilisation involves the fusion of the male and female
						sex cells, the sperm and ovum, in the fallopian tubes.</li>
					<li>Sperm can survive in the female reproductive system for up
						to about 72 hours; the ovum lives for only 12 to 24 hours. For
						fertilisation to occur, sperm must be deposited in the vagina not
						more than three days before ovulation, or within 24 hours after
						ovulation.</li>
					<li>After fertilisation, cell division starts to form the
						developing embryo in stages, including the morula (solid ball of
						cells) and then the blastocyst (hollow ball of cells).</li>
					<li>Transportation of the embryo along the fallopian tube to
						the uterus takes about five to seven days.</li>
					<li>Implantation of the embryo takes place in the endometrium
						(lining) of the uterus. If it occurs in the fallopian tube, it is
						called an ectopic pregnancy, and this is very dangerous for the
						woman.</li>
					<li>The trophoblast region of the blastocyst penetrates the
						endometrium, and projections called villi secrete chemicals that
						dissolve maternal blood vessels. Maternal blood bathes the fetal
						blood vessels in the placenta, and nutrients, oxygen and dissolved
						waste is exchanged between mother and fetus.</li>
					<li>The maternal and fetal blood never mix in the placenta.</li>
					<li>The placenta functions as a transport site, a filter for
						beneficial and harmful substances, and a hormone-secreting organ.</li>
