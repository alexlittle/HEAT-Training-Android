		<p>In this study session you will learn about the bony structures
			with the most importance for the pregnant woman and the baby she will
			give birth to. The bones of the skeleton have the main function of
			supporting our body weight and acting as attachment points for our
			muscles. The focus in this study session will be on the female
			pelvis, which supports the major load of the pregnant uterus, and the
			fetal skull, which has to pass through the woman's pelvis when she
			gives birth.</p>
		<p>
			There are certain key landmarks in the anatomy of the female pelvis
			and the fetal skull that we will show you in this study session.
			Knowing these landmarks will enable you to estimate the progress of
			labour, by identifying changes in their relative positions as the
			baby passes down the birth canal. You will learn how to do this in
			the next Module in this curriculum, which is on <i>Labour and
				Delivery Care</i>.
