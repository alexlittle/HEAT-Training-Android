		<p>In Study Session 6, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The bony pelvis is composed of the ilium, ischium, pubic
				bones and sacrum.</li>
			<li>The size and shape of the bony pelvis can affect the ease or
				difficulty of labour and delivery; a broad pelvis gives less
				difficulty than a narrow one, which may obstruct the descent of the
				baby down the birth canal.</li>
			<li>Certain landmarks in the anatomy of the pelvis are commonly
				used to estimate the descent of the baby during labour and delivery.
				The two most important landmarks are the ischial spines and the
				sacral promontory, which can be felt with the fingers during a
				vaginal examination.</li>
			<li>The pelvic inlet is the space where the baby's head enters
				the pelvis; it is larger than the pelvic outlet, where the baby's
				head emerges from the pelvis. In order to get through the widest
				diameter of the inlet and the outlet, the baby has to rotate as it
				passes through the pelvic canal.</li>
			<li>The skull is formed by several bones joined tightly together
				by joints called sutures. In the fetus and newborn, spaces called
				fontanels exist between some of the skull bones on the top of the
				baby's head. The position of the sutures and the fontanels can tell
				you about the angle at which the baby's head is presenting during
				labour and delivery.</li>
			<li>The vertex presentation (where the top of the baby's head is
				the presenting part) is the most common and the safest presentation
				for a normal vaginal delivery. Other presentations carry a much
				higher risk for the mother and baby.</li>
