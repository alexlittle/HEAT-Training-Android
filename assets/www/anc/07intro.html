		<p>In this study session, you will learn about some of the
					changes that occur during pregnancy in the uterus, cervix and
					vagina, the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, and
					urinary system, and about changes in the breasts and skin. You will
					also learn about the implications of all these changes for you as a
					health worker managing the health of pregnant women. By
					understanding the normal changes of pregnancy, you can reassure the
					woman if she is concerned, and also detect and intervene more
					quickly if you notice any abnormalities. A basic knowledge of these
					changes and adaptations is also critical for understanding the
					results of laboratory tests that may be conducted at a health
					facility during the pregnancy.</p>
