		<p>In Study Session 7, you have learned that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Oestrogen and progesterone are the chief pregnancy
						hormones.</li>
					<li>High levels of progesterone cause some internal structures
						to increase in size, including the uterus which changes from the
						size of a small pear in its non-pregnant state to five times its
						normal size at full term.</li>
					<li>The expected increase in weight of the mother in an
						average pregnancy is 9-12 kg.</li>
					<li>A higher circulating blood volume is required to provide
						extra blood flow through the placenta to the fetus, and the mother
						also produces more red blood cells.</li>
					<li>The increase in blood volume exceeds the increase in red
						blood cells, so they are diluted in the much larger volume of
						blood plasma, causing physiological anaemia. This is one reason
						why iron supplementation is so important in pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Lower blood pressure is particularly common in early
						pregnancy because progesterone causes a slight relaxation in the
						blood vessels. This can cause dizziness and perhaps even a brief
						loss of consciousness.</li>
					<li>A reduction in blood flow back to the heart may lead to
						oedema - swelling due to fluid collecting in the legs and
						feet.</li>
					<li>During pregnancy, many women get short of breath because
						the growing baby crowds the mother's lungs and she has less room
						to breathe. She may also experience indigestion as her stomach is
						pushed higher.</li>
					<li>During pregnancy, the muscles in the walls of the
						gastrointestinal system relax slightly, and the rate at which food
						moves along the gut is slowed down. This maximises the absorption
						of nutrients into the mother's blood, which is good for the fetus,
						but the mother may also experience nausea or constipation.</li>
					<li>Needing to urinate often is normal, especially in the
						first and last months of pregnancy, because the growing uterus
						presses against the bladder. At night, the bladder fills more
						quickly as fluid (oedema) that collected in the legs during the
						day is re-absorbed.</li>
					<li>Changes in the woman's hormones, and mechanical stretching
						of her growing abdomen and breasts, can cause stretch marks in the
						skin of these areas during pregnancy. Other skin changes may
						include brown pigmentation and increased sweating.</li>
					<li>In the second trimester, the breasts begin to produce
						colostrum - a yellowish secretion that thickens as
						pregnancy progresses. It is rich in proteins and maternal
						antibodies, and should always be fed to newborn babies.</li>
