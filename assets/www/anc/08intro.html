			This study session begins by providing you with the knowledge to
			diagnose when a woman is pregnant. You will learn to distinguish
			between the possible, the probable, and the positive (or sure) signs
			and symptoms of pregnancy. A <b>symptom </b>is an indication of a
			condition (such as pregnancy), or a disease or disorder, that is
			noticed by the affected person and which they can tell you about
			either spontaneously, or if you ask the right questions. By contrast,
			a <b>sign</b> is an indication that only a trained health
			professional would notice, or be able to detect by conducting a test.
		</p>
		<p>
			To give good care to a pregnant woman, you also need to find out
			about her general health and any past pregnancies and births she may
			have had, and what this pregnancy has been like so far. These details
			are called a <b>health history</b>. The process of gathering all the
			information and recording it using clear, accessible questions is
			called <b>history taking</b>. In this study session you will learn
			how to ask focused questions about a pregnant woman's health history.
			This knowledge will help you give correct and individualised advice
			to make this pregnancy and birth as safe as possible. You will also
			recognise the importance of maintaining the woman's trust by keeping
			what she says to you confidential.
