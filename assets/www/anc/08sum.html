		<p>In Study Session 8, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It is important to maintain the trust of the woman when you
				question her about her health history; keep your notes confidential
				and don't tell anyone else what she says.</li>
			<li>The questions you ask should be respectful and in accessible
				language the woman can understand.</li>
			<li>Making a pregnancy diagnosis is based on a combination of
				possible symptoms reported by the woman, and probable and positive
				signs and symptoms that you observe yourself, or which can be
				confirmed by a physical examination or chemical test.</li>
			<li>The most commonly reported possible symptoms of early
				pregnancy are stopping monthly bleeding; breast changes; nausea and
				vomiting, especially in the morning; feeling tired during the day;
				urinating more often; quickening (feeling light movements of the
				baby); and chloasma.</li>
			<li>The probable signs and symptoms of pregnancy are abdominal
				enlargement; a positive pregnancy test for the hormone HCG; and
				painless uterine contractions. The positive (sure) signs are
				detection of fetal heart tones; palpation of the fetus; and visual
				confirmation by ultrasound examination, where facilities exist.</li>
			<li>Very young or older women, first-time mothers, and women who
				have had many previous births are more likely to experience
				antenatal problems, and should generally be referred to a health
				facility for labour and delivery.</li>
			<li>It is important to ask the woman clearly focused questions
				to identify other risk factors, such as, previous miscarriage or
				abortion; very large or small babies at birth; a prolonged or very
				short labour; a fistula; caesarian surgery or heavy bleeding before
				or after the birth; retained placenta; postnatal depression; a baby
				who died or had birth defects; or a history of medical conditions
				such as high blood pressure, diabetes, anaemia, pre-eclampsia or
				eclampsia, infections, and heart, kidney or liver problems.</li>
