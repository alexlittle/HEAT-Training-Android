		<p>This study session shows you how to conduct a general
			assessment of the pregnant woman's health status during an antenatal
			visit. You should make all of these assessments every time you see
			her for antenatal care. For each assessment, we first describe the
			signs and symptoms that indicate the pregnant woman is in good
			health. Then we describe the warning signs and symptoms that may
			indicate health problems that may lead to a serious complication of
			pregnancy, including anaemia, diabetes, poor nutrition, iodine
			deficiency, hypertension, fever, infection, lung and kidney problems.</p>
		<p>Later in this module, you will learn about the most serious
			complications of pregnancy in more detail - HIV infection in
			Study Session 16; premature rupture of the fetal membranes in Study
			Session 17; anaemia, malaria and urinary tract infections in Study
			Session 18; hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Study
			Session 19; and bleeding in early and late pregnancy in Study
			Sessions 20 and 21.</p>
