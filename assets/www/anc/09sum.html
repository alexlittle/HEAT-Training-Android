		<p>In Study Session 9, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>At every antenatal visit you should assess all pregnant
				women for signs and symptoms of poor nutrition or iodine deficiency,
				including pallor, lack of energy and goitre.</li>
			<li>Most women gain 9-12 kg during a normal pregnancy, but
				weight gain is not a reliable indicator of pregnancy outcome. Sudden
				weight gain near the end of pregnancy is a warning of possible
				pre-eclampsia and the woman should be referred to a health centre.</li>
			<li>Fever (a temperature of above 37.5oC) should be treated
				initially with fluids, paracetamol and cold sponging. Refer a
				pregnant woman to a health centre if her temperature stays high. She
				needs to be screened for infections such as malaria.</li>
			<li>If the pulse rate rises above 100 beats per minute, it is a
				sign of ill health and the woman needs referral to a health centre.</li>
			<li>Signs and symptoms of anaemia include pallor, tiredness,
				fast pulse and shortness of breath. Refer pregnant women with these
				characteristics.</li>
			<li>Shortness of breath is usual near the end of pregnancy as
				the growing baby crowds the mother's lungs. Refer her if it causes
				major discomfort.</li>
			<li>If the blood pressure of a pregnant woman reaches 140/90
				mmHg or higher, she has hypertension. All hypertension in pregnancy
				is a serious illness, which requires immediate referral to a health
				centre.</li>
			<li>Abnormal vaginal discharge, itching or swelling of the
				external genitalia, and burning or pain when urinating or during
				sex, are symptoms of vaginal infection, and the woman should be
				referred.</li>
