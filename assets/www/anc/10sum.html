		<p>In Study Session 10, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Measuring the fundal height tells you the duration of the
				pregnancy, how fast the baby is growing, and the probable due date.</li>
			<li>Remember to position the woman correctly before measuring
				the fundal height. The fundus of the uterus grows on average two
				finger-widths for each month of pregnancy.</li>
			<li>If the fundal height is not equal to the gestational age,
				you need to check the duration of pregnancy from the last normal
				menstrual period (LNMP). Having the wrong date is one of the main
				reasons for discrepancy between fundal height and gestational age.</li>
			<li>If the fundal height is bigger than expected for gestational
				age, the mother may have given you the wrong LNMP, or she may have
				twins, diabetes, too much water in the uterus, or a molar pregnancy.</li>
			<li>If the fundal height is smaller than expected for
				gestational age, the mother may have given you the wrong LNMP, she
				may have too little amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, raised
				blood pressure, poor nutrition, she may be drinking alcohol or
				taking other harmful drugs, or the baby may be dead.</li>
