		<p>During pregnancy, a woman's body changes in many ways -
			as you learned in Study Session 7. These changes can sometimes be
			uncomfortable, but most of the time they are normal. They can occur
			at any time during the pregnancy. In this study session, you will
			learn about some of the most common minor disorders of pregnancy, and
			discuss ways to help women feel better, or at least to stop worrying
			about them. We will also explain how to tell when a woman's
			discomfort may be a sign that there could be a problem that requires
			further investigation and management, or even that something
			dangerous is happening with her pregnancy. Most of the minor
			disorders during pregnancy can be minimised with good education and
			prompt treatment. You should also know about some remedies that are
			dangerous for pregnant women and may hurt the baby.</p>
