			In Part 1 of the <i>Antenatal Care</i> Module, you have learned
			mainly about how the human reproductive system is structured
			anatomically and how it functions, the normal process and adaptation
			of pregnancy, the general assessment of the progress of pregnancy,
			and how to identify minor disorders. In Part 2 of the <i>Antenatal
				Care</i> Module, you will first learn about the basic principles of
			focused antenatal care (FANC).
		</p>
		<p>This session will start by describing the concepts and
			principles of FANC and the basic differences between FANC and the
			traditional approach to antenatal care. It will highlight the other
			study sessions in Part 2 which all rest under the umbrella of FANC.
			You will also learn the objectives of each of the four FANC visits.
			The study session concludes with the preparations you and the
			pregnant woman should make for the birth, advice about what to do if
			complications arise, and instructions on how to write a referral note
			if she has to be transferred to a health facility.</p>
