		<p>In Study Session 13, you learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Focused antenatal care (FANC) segregates pregnant women into
				those eligible to receive routine ANC (the basic component) and
				those who need specialised care for specific health conditions or
				risk factors.</li>
			<li>FANC emphasises targeted and individualised care planning
				and birth planning.</li>
			<li>FANC makes the pregnant woman, with her husband and the
				family, participatory in identifying pregnancy related or unrelated
				complications, planning and decision-making on the future course of
				pregnancy.</li>
			<li>Until proved otherwise, no pregnancy is to be labelled as
				risk-free.</li>
			<li>A pregnant woman has four antenatal visits, each with
				specific objectives to promote FANC the health of the mother and the
				fetus, assess risks, and give early detection of complications.</li>
			<li>The first FANC visit should be before week 16 of pregnancy;
				it assesses the woman's medical and obstetric history, physical
				examination and test results, to determine her eligibility to follow
				the basic component.</li>
			<li>The second FANC visit is at 24-28 weeks. The additional
				focus is on measuring blood pressure and fundal height to determine
				gestational age.</li>
			<li>The third FANC visit is at 30â€“32 weeks. The additional focus
				is on detecting multiple pregnancies.</li>
			<li>The fourth is the final FANC visit between weeks 36 and 40.
				The additional focus is on detecting breech presentation and
				transverse fetal lie, and signs of hypertensive disorders. Pay extra
				attention to informing women about birth preparedness, complication
				readiness and emergency planning.</li>
			<li>Complication readiness and emergency planning anticipates
				and prepares for the actions needed in case of an emergency,
				including organising transport, money, support persons and blood
				donors, and reducing sources of delay in getting to the higher level
				health facility.</li>
			<li>Women who need to be referred at any stage during the
				pregnancy, or when labour begins, should be accompanied by a
				referral note with all relevant details of their history, diagnosis
				and treatment.</li>
