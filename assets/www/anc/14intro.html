			<b>Health promotion</b> refers to any activity that aims to achieve
			better health in a community or a country. It includes the <b>health
				education</b> of individuals to enable them to control and change their
			lifestyles so that their health is improved. This is the main focus
			of this study session, in the context of your role as a health
			educator of pregnant women during antenatal care visits. But as you
			know from Study Session 2 of this Module, health promotion activities
			go far beyond this focus on individual behaviour, and include a wide
			range of social and environmental interventions that increase health
			and wellbeing in populations as well as individuals. Health promotion
			also includes <b>disease prevention</b> - actions taken to prevent a
			disease from developing, and <b>health screening</b> - the routine
			testing of individuals to see if they are at risk of developing a
			health problem. The relationship between health promotion, health
			education, disease prevention and health screening is represented in
			Figure 2.1 in Study Session 2.
		</p>
		<p>Antenatal care (FANC, Study Session 13) provides a key entry
			point for a broad range of health promotion and disease prevention
			services. It is essential for healthcare providers and women to talk
			about important issues affecting the woman's health and her
			pregnancy.</p>
		<p>During the antenatal period, you can promote the health of the
			women in your care and the health of their babies before and after
			birth, by educating mothers about the benefits of good nutrition,
			adequate rest, good hygiene, family planning and exclusive
			breastfeeding, and immunization and other disease prevention
			measures. Your aim is to develop women's knowledge of these issues so
			they can make better informed decisions affecting their pregnancy
			outcome - but you should never lose sight of the difficulties some
			women will face in being able to improve their lifestyles.</p>
