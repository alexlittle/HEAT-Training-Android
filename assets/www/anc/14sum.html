		<p>In Study Session 14 you learned that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Eating well during pregnancy and breastfeeding means
						eating a variety of foods and enough foods - at least 200
						additional calories every day.</li>
					<li>Eating well with little money is possible by buying cheap
						nutritious foods like beans and organ meats, growing legumes,
						keeping chickens, using whole grains, and making soups.</li>
					<li>Pregnant and breastfeeding women need to eat a variety of
						main foods (carbohydrates), grow foods (proteins), go foods
						(sugars and fats), and glow foods (vitamins and minerals,
						particularly iron, folate, calcium, iodine and Vitamin A).</li>
					<li>Iron pills and folate (folic acid) tablets should be
						provided to pregnant women as part of routine antenatal care.</li>
					<li>Personal hygiene, especially hand washing and keeping the
						genital area clean, helps to prevent infection during pregnancy
						(and at all times).</li>
					<li>Getting plenty of rest and sleep, and avoiding alcohol,
						cigarettes, illegal drugs, strong chemicals and infectious persons
						helps to protect the pregnant woman and her unborn baby.</li>
					<li>Immunization against tetanus should be a routine part of
						antenatal care.</li>
					<li>Feeding colostrum, followed by full and exclusive
						breastfeeding, is the best and only nourishment a baby needs in
						the first 6 months of life.</li>
					<li>Full and exclusive breastfeeding may protect the woman
						from becoming pregnant again up to 6 months after the birth, but
						only if feeding is very frequent and her menstrual periods have
						not returned.</li>
					<li>Birth spacing of at least 2 years is good for the health
						of the woman, her baby and any older children - in fact for
						all her family.</li>
