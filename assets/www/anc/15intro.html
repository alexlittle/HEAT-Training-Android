		<p>This study session will provide you with the knowledge of how
					to counsel pregnant women on the common danger symptoms that some
					of them may develop in the course of their pregnancy. Effective
					counselling in language that the women in your community can
					understand will enable them to know when to get help quickly from
					you or from a health facility, if one of these danger symptoms
					develops.</p>
				<p>
					You have already understood the different meaning of <b>symptoms
					</b>and <b>signs </b>in Study Session 8, and in Study Session 9 you
					learned about the common danger signs and symptoms during
					pregnancy. This study session will start by briefly explaining the
					general principles of counselling and the special features of
					counselling pregnant women. Then we summarise the common
					pregnancy-related or unrelated danger symptoms that pregnant women
					themselves can feel or notice in relation to the gestational age.
					Later in this session, we guide you about when and how to counsel
					pregnant women in relation to these danger symptoms, and we
					emphasise the importance of involving the husband/partner in this
					counselling.
