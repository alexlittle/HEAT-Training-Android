					In Study Session 15 you learned that:<b> </b>
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Counselling is a two-way confidential communication
						process that helps pregnant women to examine their personal
						issues, make decisions, and make plans for taking action if they
						develop danger symptoms.</li>
					<li>Basic skills in counselling include the use of active
						listening, encouraging the pregnant woman to talk, to ask
						questions freely, and focusing on relevant issues in relation to
						danger symptoms and gestational age.</li>
					<li>Every pregnant woman has the right to decide what happens
						to her pregnancy.</li>
					<li>All information that the pregnant woman provides during
						her visit should be kept confidential.</li>
					<li>Common errors in counselling include<b> </b>interrupting
						the woman when she is talking, looking away frequently,
						criticising her cultural and religious values, finishing off her
						sentences and judging her.
					</li>
					<li>The counselling process goes through<b> </b>the following
						stages: opening and building relationships, exploring the issues,
						facilitating change, and closing.
					</li>
					<li>The pregnant woman should be counselled to come to you at
						once if she develops one or more of the following danger symptoms:
						<ul>
							<li><i>Usually in the first half of pregnancy</i>:
								persistent vomiting, weight loss, vaginal bleeding and no change
								in abdominal growth.</li>
							<li><i>Usually in the second half of pregnancy</i>:
								headache, blurred vision, epigastric burning pain, vaginal
								bleeding, leakage of fluid from the vagina, no change in
								abdominal growth, decreased or absent fetal kick.</li>
							<li><i>Any time during pregnancy</i>: fever, vomiting, flank
								pain, yellowish discoloration of eyes or persistent cough.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Involving the husband or partner in the antenatal care
						visits makes care of the pregnant woman a family concern and
						responsibility, and also helps them to be alert to danger symptoms
						that need urgent action.</li>
