					<b>HIV</b> (the <b>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</b>) destroys the
					body's defences against other infections, which lead to death if
					the person is not treated appropriately with anti-HIV drugs. HIV is
					carried in the blood of an infected person and also appears in the
					genital tract of infected men and women. It can be transmitted from
					one person to another by unprotected sexual intercourse (sex
					without a condom) or by transfer of infected blood. The virus can
					also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during
					labour and delivery, and during breastfeeding.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important for you to counsel pregnant women about prevention
					of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, and to test them
					for HIV, as a routine part of antenatal care. This study session
					explains what you need to know about PMTCT so you can discuss it
					effectively with pregnant women during antenatal visits. We also
					tell you about a blood test for HIV, which will become available
					for you to use in women's homes or at your Health Post. When you
					study the next two Modules in this curriculum, <i>Labour and
						Delivery Care </i>and<i> Postnatal Care, </i>you will learn about the
					policy and practice of PMTCT during those periods. The Module on <i>Communicable
						Diseases</i> covers HIV testing, prevention and treatment in the whole
					community. Here we focus on pregnant women before they give birth.
