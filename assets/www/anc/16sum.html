		<p>In Study Session 16, you have learnt that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The common risk factors for increased chance of mother to
						child transmission of HIV during the antenatal period are:
						anything that breaks the normal barrier separating the maternal
						and fetal blood supply in the placenta, such as placental
						infection or bleeding, injury, vigorous abdominal massage,
						maternal malnutrition and cigarette smoking; exposure of the baby
						to infected vaginal fluid or maternal blood during labour and
						delivery; and prolonged exposure to HIV in breastmilk.</li>
					<li>PMTCT of HIV is offered as a routine component of standard
						maternal and child healthcare. It is the first stage in the
						ongoing prevention, treatment, care and support of HIV-positive
						pregnant women, their babies and partners.</li>
					<li>HIV testing and counselling is one of the core
						interventions of PMTCT of HIV. The others are: giving
						antiretroviral drugs to HIV-positive women and their newborn
						babies, safe delivery practices, and safe baby feeding practices.</li>
					<li>The opt-out provider-initiated counselling approach for
						HIV testing is more effective than the opt-in approach and is
						recommended by the Ethiopian national guidelines.</li>
					<li>The HIV Rapid Test (HIVRT) is the most commonly used HIV
						antibody test in Ethiopia and is suitable for blood testing in
						homes and at the Health Post.</li>
					<li>A positive HIV test result must be confirmed by a second
						test using a test kit from a different manufacturer. If the second
						test disagrees with the result of the first test, a third test is
						conducted as a 'tie breaker' using the HIV Rapid Test
						Algorithm (Figure 16.2).</li>
					<li>HIV-positive women should be strongly encouraged to give
						birth in a higher health facility where more advanced methods of
						PMTCT and additional ARP drugs (antiretroviral prophylaxis) can be
						given than are available at community level.</li>
					<li>Post-test counselling for HIV-positive and HIV-negative
						women should include advice about safe sex practices, encouraging
						the woman's husband or partner to be tested for HIV, and the
						importance of family planning and birth spacing.</li>
					<li>HIV-positive pregnant women will need additional ongoing
						care and support, referrals and follow-up for themselves, their
						exposed babies, their partners and other family members.</li>
