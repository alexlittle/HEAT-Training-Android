		<p>In Study Session 17, you learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a spontaneous
				rupture of fetal membranes and leakage of fluid from the vagina
				after 28 weeks of gestation and at least one hour before the onset
				of true labour.</li>
			<li>PROM is classified as preterm PROM when the leakage of fluid
				occurs before 37 completed weeks of gestation, and term PROM when it
				occurs after 37 weeks.</li>
			<li>Women with prolonged PROM (12 or more hours passed since the
				rupture of fetal membranes) are highly likely to develop infection
				in the uterus unless they get swift antibiotic treatment.</li>
			<li>The commonest risk factors for PROM include infection in the
				reproductive tract, fetal malpresentations (breech or transverse
				lie), multiple pregnancy, excess amniotic fluid, cervical
				incompetence, and abdominal trauma.</li>
			<li>The diagnosis of PROM is based on a history of sudden and
				painless leakage of moderate or excess watery fluid from the vagina.
				You may witness the woman's soaked underwear, feel easily palpable
				fetal parts through her abdominal wall, and measure the uterine size
				as 'small for gestational age' because her abdomen has shrunk.</li>
			<li>The common complications of PROM are infection in the mother
				and/or the fetus/newborn, cord prolapse, intrauterine fetal
				asphyxia/death, placental abruption, preterm labour, and deformity
				of the fetal limbs.</li>
			<li>Fever, foul smelling vaginal discharge, increased maternal
				pulse rate, increased fetal heartbeat and lower abdominal pain are
				signs of infection in the uterine cavity, which needs to be treated
				quickly with antibiotics.</li>
			<li>To minimize the risk of infection, gloved digital pelvic
				examination should be avoided in women with PROM.</li>
			<li>Deliver the baby and then refer in cases of term or preterm
				PROM where the woman is already in advanced labour, even if there is
				evidence of infection or in cases of term PROM if labour has begun
				normally and there is no evidence of infection.</li>
			<li>Refer as soon as possible all women with PROM coming to you
				before the onset of labour, or in early labour, with established
				maternal or neonatal infection; refer all preterm babies immediately
				after delivery.</li>
			<li>Make sure that the woman with PROM and her family are well
				aware of the risks of waiting at home; counsel them to call you at
				once and take transport to the health facility.</li>
