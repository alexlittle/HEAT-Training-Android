		<p>In Study Session 18 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol class="oucontent-numbered">
			<li>Malaria is caused by a parasite that is spread by
				mosquitoes.</li>
			<li>A pregnant woman with malaria is more likely to have
				anaemia, miscarriage, early birth, small baby, stillbirth (baby born
				dead), or to die herself.</li>
			<li>It is important for pregnant women to avoid getting malaria
				- for example by using insecticide-treated bed nets - and to be
				treated quickly if they get sick.</li>
			<li>Malaria medicines may be costly and can have side-effects,
				but these medicines are much safer than actually getting sick with
				malaria, particularly during pregnancy. The usual anti-malaria
				medicine in Ethiopia is Coartem.</li>
			<li>Iron helps the blood carry oxygen from the air we breathe to
				all parts of the body. Too little iron in a pregnant woman's diet
				means she will be short of breath because she is anaemic.</li>
			<li>Women with anaemia have less strength for childbirth and are
				more likely to bleed heavily, become ill after childbirth, or even
				die.</li>
			<li>Eating a diet rich in iron and folate, and taking these
				essential nutrients in tablets every day during pregnancy, can
				prevent anaemia from developing, and treat mild cases of anaemia.</li>
			<li>The urinary tract includes the kidneys, kidney tubes,
				bladder and urethra. UTIs are common during pregnancy and can be
				prevented by good hygiene.</li>
			<li>Bladder and kidney infections can be dangerous for the
				mother and can also cause her to start labour too early if they are
				not treated right away. Drinking a lot of clean liquids is often
				sufficient to flush the bacteria out of the body.</li>
			<li>Itching or burning while urinating is a common symptom of
				bladder infection; mild bladder infections can be treated with
				antibiotics. The usual antibiotic in Ethiopia at Health Post level
				is Amoxicillin.</li>
			<li>Kidney infection is paricularly dangerous and the woman
				should be referred immediately if she has cloudy or bloody urine,
				fever, and pain in the lower back.</li>
