		<p>A major purpose of your antenatal care service is to make
			pregnant women aware of the danger symptoms of hypertensive
			disorders, to check their blood pressure at every antenatal visit
			(you learned how to do this in Study Session 9), and to make a timely
			diagnosis of hypertension and refer affected women as early as
			possible.</p>
		<p>In this study session you will learn about the changes in the
			woman's body as a result of hypertension and how this affects the
			mother and the fetus, the classifications of hypertension, the common
			risk factors for developing it, how to diagnose the different types
			and what actions to take in order to prevent worsening complications
			and even death.</p>
