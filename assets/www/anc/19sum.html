		<p>In Study Session 19, you learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the common
				causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.</li>
			<li>Generalised constriction of blood vessels is a fundamental
				phenomenon of pregnancy-related hypertension. It brings about a
				marked reduction in the woman's blood volume, as fluids leave the
				blood vessels and accumulate in the tissues. Oedema occurs in
				different tissues and organs (including the brain, liver and
				kidneys), and leads to a significant reduction in blood supply to
				different parts of the mother's body, and to the placenta.</li>
			<li>Known risk factors for pregnancy related hypertension
				include: being primigravida before the age of 20 years or after 35
				years, multiple pregnancies, personal or family history of
				pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, having diabetes or kidney disease, or
				being obese.</li>
			<li>Pre-eclampsia (raised blood pressure + significant
				proteinuria) is the most common type of hypertension during
				pregnancy. Severe pre-eclampsia is characterised by clinical
				manifestations such as headache, visual disturbance, epigastric
				pain, decreased urine output, decreased fetal kick and development
				of generalised oedema.</li>
			<li>Eclampsia is diagnosed when the pregnant woman develops
				convulsion or coma in the absence of other causes. It is the leading
				cause of maternal and fetal death among all types of hypertensive
				disorders of pregnancy.</li>
			<li>In classical cases, eclampsia has four stages: quiet, tonic,
				clonic and coma stages.</li>
			<li>The coma stage can be long if there is recurrent convulsion,
				significant brain oedema, much intracranial haemorrhage or
				associated hypoglycaemia.</li>
			<li>The very common complications of severe pre-eclampsia
				include eclampsia, anaemia, low platelet count, multiple and acute
				failure of organs (kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and eyes).</li>
			<li>The fetal complications include placental abruption,
				intrauterine and early neonatal asphyxia (due to low oxygen levels
				in the blood), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and
				intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).</li>
			<li>In the management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
				your primary role is facilitating early referral.</li>
