			In this study session you will learn about the main causes of <b>early
				pregnancy bleeding</b>, that is when a woman bleeds while pregnant and
			before 28 weeks, which should not happen normally. Abortion is one of
			the most common causes of early pregnancy bleeding and is an
			important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity globally. In
			addition, about 15 out of 100 pregnancies end in <b>spontaneous
				abortion</b> (miscarriage). You will learn how to classify abortions so
			you can give appropriate care, and about the legal aspects of
			abortion in Ethiopia and safe methods of abortion used in health
			facilities. Ectopic and molar pregnancies are the other main causes
			of early pregnancy bleeding. A woman can have serious health problems
			when a pregnancy ends early, so you need to know about the warning
			signs. The session ends with guidance on pre-referral emergency care
			that could save a woman's life, and post-abortion counselling and
			family planning, which are important aspects of your role.
