		<p>In Study Session 20 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Early pregnancy bleeding occurs before 28 weeks of
				gestation.</li>
			<li>Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) occurs spontaneously in
				about 15% of pregnancies.</li>
			<li>Common causes of early pregnancy bleeding are spontaneous or
				induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy. These
				conditions can lead to major complications, including maternal
				mortality, particularly when unsafe abortions are performed by
				unskilled people in unhygienic environments.</li>
			<li>When the law permits, women can get safe abortion services
				in health facilities. Medical and surgical options are available to
				provide safe abortion services under the provision of Ethiopian law.</li>
			<li>Warning signs after an abortion include strong cramping
				pains in the lower abdomen, swollen or hard abdomen, heavy bleeding,
				a bad smell coming from the vagina, fever, fast pulse, nausea,
				dizziness and shock. These are signs that emergency treatment and
				referral should begin immediately.</li>
			<li>Emergency treatment for haemorrhage or shock include
				starting an intravenous (IV) infusion before transferring the woman
				to a health facility, accompanied by a potential blood donor.</li>
			<li>Family planning should be part of woman-friendly
				comprehensive post-abortion care services, to break the cycle in
				case of induced abortions and to give time for recovery in cases
				where the abortion was spontaneous.</li>
