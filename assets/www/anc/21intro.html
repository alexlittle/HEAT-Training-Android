		<p>As the first contact provider for pregnant women in your
			community, you have to work with them on birth preparedness and
			making a complication readiness plan to address such eventualities as
			severe bleeding in pregnancy. You must provide obstetric first aid
			and then make sure that a woman with late pregnancy bleeding can
			reach a health facility where she can get urgent help. A District
			Hospital or Health Centre with the ability to perform obstetric
			operations can save her life.</p>
