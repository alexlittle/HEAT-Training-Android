		<p>In Study Session 21 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Late pregnancy bleeding (ante-partum haemorrhage) can cause
				maternal and fetal death, and should be treated as a potentially
				life-threatening emergency.</li>
			<li>The most common causes of life-threatening late pregnancy
				bleeding are placental abruption and placenta previa, or more rarely
				it can result from a ruptured uterus.</li>
			<li>Less serious bleeding can arise from a varicose vein in the
				genital area, or blood resulting from a heavy show, which usually
				stops on its own.</li>
			<li>Placental abruption can present with both concealed
				(internal) and revealed (externally visible) bleeding from the
				vagina; the blood is usually dark and the woman may report abdominal
				pain.</li>
			<li>Placenta previa often presents with painless, bright red
				bleeding and can be associated with abnormal presentation of the
				fetus. Usually (but not always) fetal condition is normal.</li>
			<li>Never do a vaginal examination in women with late pregnancy
				bleeding as this may precipitate severe bleeding.</li>
			<li>Initial assessment of the woman's vital signs and initiation
				of IV fluid therapy are the critical first steps in managing
				haemorrhagic shock in women with severe late pregnancy bleeding.</li>
			<li>After putting up an IV infusion, transfer the patient
				immediately to a District Hospital or higher health facility with an
				operating theatre, as most cases require surgical intervention.</li>
