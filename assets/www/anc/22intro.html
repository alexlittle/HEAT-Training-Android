		<p>In this session you will learn about two very important
			techniques for emergency care of the pregnant woman who is either:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>haemorrhaging</b> (losing blood very quickly from her
				uterus), for reasons already described in Study Sessions 20 and 21;
				or who</li>
			<li>cannot <b>urinate</b> (pass urine) because there is an
				obstruction preventing her from emptying her bladder. Usually this
				is because the pressure of the baby is blocking the urethra â€“ the
				tube that brings urine down from her bladder.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This study session is preparation for the practical skills
			training in both these techniques, which you will receive during an
			attachment in a health centre or hospital. Here we introduce you to
			the equipment you will need, and describe how to start and maintain
			IV fluid therapy and how to catheterise the bladder of the pregnant
			woman. You will also learn to follow infection control procedures
			while performing these techniques.</p>
		<p>Before you begin either of these techniques, explain to the
			woman in local language what you are going to do and why she needs
			this procedure. Tell her that as soon as you have finished doing it,
			she must go to the higher health facility for further treatment.</p>
