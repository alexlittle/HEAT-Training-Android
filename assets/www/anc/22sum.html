		<p>In Study Session 22 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is required to replace lost
				fluids in a pregnant woman who is losing a lot of blood.</li>
			<li>Giving IV fluid therapy includes knowing how to assemble the
				necessary equipment, identify a suitable venipuncture site, insert a
				cannula into a vein and stabilise it, and maintain a rapid flow rate
				of fluid into the woman's circulation.</li>
			<li>Reasons for stopping IV fluid therapy include: the woman's
				blood pressure and pulse return to normal, fluid leaks into the
				tissues around the venipuncture site instead of running into the
				vein, there are signs of infection around the venipuncture site, or
				the woman has received too much fluid and is showing signs that her
				heart or lungs may be affected.</li>
			<li>Catheterisation of the bladder involves introducing a
				sterile rubber or plastic tube through the urethra and into the
				bladder to drain excess urine. The procedure is necessary when the
				bladder is distended due to an obstruction preventing the woman from
				urinating normally, e.g. during a long or obstructed labour.</li>
			<li>The catheter is anchored in the bladder by injecting sterile
				water into the catheter balloon to inflate it and hold the catheter
				in place.</li>
			<li>A closed drainage system is important for collecting the
				urine; an open system can result in infection travelling back up the
				tubing into the bladder.</li>
			<li>Infection control procedures should be observed at all times
				when giving IV fluid therapy or catheterising the bladder; wash
				hands thoroughly before and after the procedure, wear sterile or
				very clean gloves, and swab the surrounding area of skin with
				antiseptic solution or alcohol before inserting the IV cannula or
				the urinary catheter.</li>
			<li>Make sure you inform the patient what you are going to do
				before you begin these procedures and explain why it is necessary to
				help her in this way.</li>
			<li>Refer the woman to a higher health facility immediately you
				have completed the procedure. Go with her if you can.</li>
