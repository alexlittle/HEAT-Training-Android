			Ideally the same health professional will look after the pregnant
			woman and her baby from the first antenatal visit until the end of
			the postnatal period. This is known as the <b>continuum of care</b>.
			You have already studied the Module on <i>Antenatal Care.</i> Now you
			are moving on to learn about <i>Labour and Delivery Care. </i><b>Labour
			</b>is the term for the changes in anatomy and physiology in the female
			reproductive tract that prepare the fetus and the placenta for
			delivery. In the majority of cases, this happens when the baby is
			fully developed at full term, between 37-40 weeks gestation. Labour
			heralds the end of the baby's time in the uterus and the beginning of
			adaptation to life outside the mother.
		</p>
		<p>
			This first study session serves as an introduction to the <i>Labour
				and Delivery Care </i>Module. The emphasis is on helping you make the
			diagnosis of true labour and distinguishing it from false labour, and
			recognising the signs of the four stages of labour. This session will
			help you to understand the labour and delivery process, so that you
			can make accurate decisions and feel confident when you attend
			births. You will also learn how to prepare the pregnant woman to
			become aware of the changes in her body that indicate labour will
			start soon, and how to recognise the onset of true labour, so she can
			send for you to come in good time.
