		<p>In Study Session 1 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>True labour is a natural process characterised by regular,
				rhythmic and strong uterine contractions that will increase
				progressively and produce cervical effacement and dilatation.</li>
			<li>True labour can begin without a show and without the waters
				breaking (rupture of fetal membranes).</li>
			<li>A woman in a state of false labour has uterine contraction
				of irregular intervals and intensity that can be relieved by
				anti-pain medication.</li>
			<li>The woman herself can recognise true labour if you let her
				know that it is manifested by pushing down pains occurring 3–5 times
				in every 10 minutes, each contraction lasting 40–60 seconds.</li>
			<li>There are four stages of labour:
				<ul>
					<li>The first stage starts with true labour and ends with full
						cervical dilatation (10 cm); it is divided into latent and active
						phases.</li>
					<li>The second stage is from full cervical dilatation to
						delivery of the baby.</li>
					<li>The third stage is from the delivery of the baby to
						delivery of the placenta.</li>
					<li>The fourth stage is the first 4 hours after placental
						delivery when you need to follow the mother as closely as during
						labour and delivery.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>In a normally progressing labour, the baby performs seven
				cardinal movements as it passes down the birth canal: engagement -
				descent - flexion - internal rotation - extension - external
				rotation/restitution - expulsion.</li>
			<li>There is fetal descent during every cardinal movement.</li>
			<li>Moulding of the baby's skull may occur as it passes through
				the mother's pelvis, under pressure from the contractions pushing it
				through the narrow space.</li>
