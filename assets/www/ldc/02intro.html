			In the first study session in this Module, you learned how to tell if
			true labour has begun, about the four stages of labour, and the
			movements the baby makes as it descends through the birth canal. In
			this study session, you will learn how to assess the condition of a
			woman who is <i>already</i> in labour, the condition of the fetus,
			and how it is positioned in her uterus. We also want you to pay
			attention to giving 'woman-friendly care' which respects her beliefs
			and rights.
		</p>
		<p>
			Labour will already have begun in almost all cases when you are
			called to a woman's home or when she arrives at your Health Post. One
			of the most critical assessments you have to make in <i>Labour
				and Delivery Care</i> is at the time when you first attend a labour.
			Rapid early assessment is required so that you can decide on the care
			needed for the labouring mother, in case immediate referral or
			emergency measures are required. If all is well, you need to take the
			woman's history in detail and conduct a physical examination in order
			identify the stage of labour that she has reached, and discover any
			information from her history that may affect the progress or outcome
			of her labour. This study session builds on the assessment and
			history-taking skills you developed during your study of the <i>Antenatal
				Care</i> Module.
