		<p>In Study Session 2 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare your equipment for attending a labour and delivery
				in advance, so you are ready to go immediately if called.</li>
			<li>Make a rapid evaluation of the labouring woman's vital signs
				(blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature).</li>
			<li>Follow the principles of woman-friendly care by respecting
				her beliefs, wishes and rights, and empowering her and her chosen
				caregivers to support the labour and delivery.</li>
			<li>Ask about and record the woman's name, age, address,
				gravidity and parity, last menstrual period, when she first felt the
				fetus move, and how long since the first contraction.</li>
			<li>Ask about danger symptoms: vaginal bleeding, headache,
				convulsions, breathing difficulties, fever, severe abdominal pain or
				premature leakage of amniotic fluid (waters breaking).</li>
			<li>Use abdominal palpation using the four Leopold's manoeuvres
				to determine the fetal presentation and position, and the extent of
				engagement of the presenting part.</li>
			<li>Do your vaginal examination of the woman in labour to assess
				cervical dilatation, fetal presentation and descent, the condition
				of the fetal skull, and signs of vaginal infection, scarring or
				swelling.</li>
