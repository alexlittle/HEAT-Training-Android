		<p>In the previous session of this Module you were introduced to
			the definitions, signs and symptoms, and stages of normal labour.
			Labour and birth of the baby is a unique experience in the life of
			any family and one of special personal significance for the mother.
			Your constant companionship and skilful management of the birth can
			contribute much to the harmonious atmosphere and feeling of trust
			during labour and delivery, which favours a good outcome. Caring for
			the woman in labour demands sensitivity from you as the birth
			attendant, and awareness of the mother's perception of her labour and
			of her needs, as they relate to her experience.</p>
		<p>In this session you will learn about ways that you can support
			a woman all through the birth of the baby. You will also be
			introduced to the basic principles of maternal and fetal monitoring
			during labour, and learn about standard hygiene for infection
			prevention and the equipment you need to prepare for a delivery at
			home or in a health facility.</p>
