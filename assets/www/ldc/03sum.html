		<p>In Study Session 3 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All women during labour and delivery need individualised
				care. Pregnant women should be encouraged to seek support from a
				skilled birth attendant.</li>
			<li>Provide physical and psychological support to the woman in
				labour and the trusted support person who is with her.</li>
			<li>Assist her to adopt different positions, try different
				breathing patterns, be massaged on her back and make low sounds
				during labour, as this helps her to relieve pain and manage the
				contractions.</li>
			<li>Encourage her to take one cup of fluid at least every hour
				and assist her to empty her bladder at least once every two hours.</li>
			<li>Keep her informed about the progress of her labour, so she
				remains relaxed and confident.</li>
			<li>Monitor fetal condition by checking the fetal heart beat
				every 30 minutes; it should be within the normal range.</li>
			<li>Monitor maternal condition by measuring her blood pressure
				and temperature every 4 hours, and her pulse rate every 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Assess the progress of labour by checking uterine
				contractions (length, strength and frequency) every 30 minutes,
				descent of the head every two hours and cervical dilatation every
				four hours.</li>
			<li>Prepare the equipment you will need for the birth, including
				protective clothing for yourself; scrub or sterilise everything that
				will come into contact with tissue or body fluids.</li>
			<li>Hand washing with soap and clean water is the most important
				way to reduce the risk of infection being passed to the mother and
				baby during labour and delivery.</li>
