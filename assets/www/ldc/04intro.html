		<p>
			Among the five major causes of maternal mortality in developing
			countries like Ethiopia (hypertension, haemorrhage, infection,
			obstructed labour and unsafe abortion), the middle three
			(haemorrhage, infection, obstructed labour) are highly correlated
			with prolonged labour. To be specific, postpartum haemorrhage and
			postpartum sepsis (infection) are very common when the labour gets
			prolonged beyond 18â€“24 hours. Obstructed labour is the direct outcome
			of abnormally prolonged labour; you will learn about this in detail
			in Study Session 9 of this Module. To avoid such complications, a
			chart called a <i>partograph</i> will help you to identify the
			abnormal progress of a labour that is prolonged and which may be
			obstructed. It will also alert you to signs of fetal distress.
		</p>
		<p>In this study session, you will learn about the principles of
			using the partograph, the interpretation of what it tells you about
			the labour you are supervising, and what actions you should take when
			the recordings you make on the partograph deviate from the normal
			range. When the labour is progressing well, the record on the
			partograph reassures you and the mother that she and her baby are in
			good health.</p>
