			In Study Session 4, you have learned that:<b> </b>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The partograph is a valuable tool to help you detect
				abnormal progress of labour, fetal distress and signs that the
				mother is in difficulty.</li>
			<li>The partograph is designed for recording maternal
				identification, fetal heart rate, colour of the amniotic fluid,
				moulding of the fetal skull, cervical dilatation, fetal descent,
				uterine contractions, whether oxytocin was administered or
				intravenous fluids were given, maternal vital signs and urine
				output.</li>
			<li>Start recording on the partograph when the labour is in
				active first stage (4 cm or above).</li>
			<li>Cervical dilatation, descent of the fetal head and uterine
				contractions are used in assessing the progress of labour. About 1
				cm/hour cervical dilatation and 1 cm descent in four hours indicate
				good progress in the active first stage.</li>
			<li>Fetal heart rate and uterine contractions are recorded every
				30 minutes if they are in the normal range. Assess cervical
				dilatation, fetal descent, the colour of amniotic fluid (if fetal
				membranes have ruptured), and the degree of moulding or caput every
				four hours.</li>
			<li>Do a digital vaginal examination immediately if the
				membranes rupture and a gush of amniotic fluid comes out while the
				woman is in any stage of labour.</li>
			<li>Refer the woman to health centre or hospital if the cervical
				dilatation mark crosses the Alert line on the partograph.</li>
			<li>When you identify +3 moulding of the fetal skull with poor
				progress of labour, this indicates labour obstruction, so refer the
				mother urgently.</li>
			<li>Fetal heart rate below 120/min or above 160/min for more
				than 10 minutes is an urgent indication to refer the mother, unless
				the labour is progressing too fast.</li>
			<li>Even with a normal fetal heart rate, refer if you see
				amniotic fluid (liquor) lightly stained with meconium in latent
				first stage of labour, or moderately stained in early active first
				stage of labour, or thick amniotic fluid in all stages of labour,
				unless the labour is progressing too fast.</li>
