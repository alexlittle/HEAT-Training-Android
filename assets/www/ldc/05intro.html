			In the previous study sessions of this Module, you were introduced to
			the definition, signs, symptoms and stages of labour and the use of
			the partograph. You also learned about care of the woman in labour.
			In this session, you will learn how to assist the woman in the second
			stage of a normal labour and how to deliver the baby. The second
			stage is the part of labour when the mother pushes the baby out of
			the uterus and down the vagina, and the baby is born. <b>Second
				stage</b> begins when the cervix is completely dilated and ends when the
			baby is delivered.
		</p>
		<p>During the second stage, the mother's passive control during
			the long hours of the first stage of labour is replaced by intense
			physical effort and exertion for a comparatively short period. The
			mother and her support person require stamina, courage and confidence
			from the birth attendant. A healthy outcome for the mother and her
			baby depends upon your competence in providing quality care and the
			successful partnership between you and the mother.</p>
