		<p>In the final study session of this Module, you will learn about
			postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), which is a leading cause of maternal
			mortality, responsible for about a quarter of all maternal deaths.
			Worldwide, around 127,000 women every year die of postpartum
			haemorrhage. The majority of these fatal cases of excessive bleeding
			occur in the first 24 hours after delivery of the baby, as a result
			of complications arising during the third stage of labour. To
			minimise the risks of PPH in this critical stage of labour, a set of
			procedures have been developed that all birth attendants should
			follow, called active management of third stage of labour (AMTSL).
			Correctly applied, AMSTL can reduce the risk of postpartum
			haemorrhage by more than 60%.</p>
		<p>In this study session, you will learn what is meant by AMTSL
			and the procedures you will conduct during each of its six steps.
			This knowledge will help you to identify the complications that may
			arise during the third stage of labour and manage them more
			effectively.</p>
