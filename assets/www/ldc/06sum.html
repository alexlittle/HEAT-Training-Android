		<p>In Study Session 6 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Active management of third stage of labour (AMTSL) is the
				best intervention to reduce the risk of PPH by more than 60%.
				Therefore, AMTSL has to be applied routinely (to all delivering
				mothers).</li>
			<li>The sequential physiological changes in the third stage of
				labour are: separation of the placenta, descent of the placenta,
				expulsion of the placenta and control of bleeding.</li>
			<li>Common complications that can occur during third stage of
				labour include retained placenta, postpartum haemorrhage and uterine
				inversion.</li>
			<li>The components of AMTSL in sequential order are checking for
				a second baby, administration of uterotonic drugs, controlled cord
				traction, uterine massage after delivery of the placenta, placental
				examination for completeness, and examining the genital area for
				lacerations and active bleeding.</li>
			<li>Oxytocin, ergometrine and misoprostol are commonly used
				uterotonic drugs. Because ergometrine is a very strong drug, it is
				not recommended for use in Ethiopia's rural Health Extension
				Service. Oxytocin and ergometrine must always be kept in a
				refrigerator until needed; misoprostol comes in tablet form.</li>
			<li>Administer misoprostol or oxytocin within one minute of the
				delivery of the baby.</li>
			<li>A well-contracted uterus is felt as firm to hard, well
				delineated and with no active vaginal bleeding, unless the source of
				bleeding is due to tear or lacerations of the lower genital area.</li>
			<li>Missed placental lobe, retained placenta, relaxed enlarged
				soft uterus, bleeding continuing despite the repeat administration
				of uterotonic drugs and uterine massage are all indications for
				setting up an intravenous line for pre-referral IV fluid infusion
				and immediate referral to a health facility.</li>
