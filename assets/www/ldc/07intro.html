				<p>
					The moment when a baby is born is also the time when the birth
					attendant has to make a very rapid assessment of the condition of
					the newborn to decide whether it needs helping to breathe. Within a
					few seconds you have to be able to identify the general danger
					signs in a newborn that tell you to intervene quickly to protect it
					from developing serious complications, or even dying, because it is
					not able to get enough oxygen into its body. Of course, most babies
					breathe spontaneously as soon as they are born and all you need to
					do is follow the steps of basic newborn care, which were briefly
					outlined in Study Session 5 of this Module. You will learn them in
					much greater detail in the Module on <i>Postnatal Care</i> and the
					steps will be covered again in the Module on <i>Integrated
						Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					However, in this study session our focus is on newborns who are <i>not</i>
					breathing well, and what you need to do in order to resuscitate
					them and get them breathing normally. You will learn how to
					distinguish between a healthy baby and one that is moderately or
					severely <b>asphyxiated</b> (i.e. short of oxygen due to breathing
					problems), and the correct action that you should take. This study
					session is unusual in that much of it is taught through diagrams.
