		<p>In Study Session 7, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The most important signs of asphyxiation in newborns at
				delivery are: difficulty breathing, gasping or no breathing;
				abnormal heart beat; poor muscle tone (floppy limbs); lack of
				movement; bluish skin colour (cyanosis), and being stained with
				meconium.</li>
			<li>Assessment of the degree of asphyxia should be done in the
				first 5 seconds after the birth, at the same time as commencing
				basic newborn care (e.g. drying the baby, keeping it warm, tying and
				cutting the cord, etc).</li>
			<li>Swift action is necessary to begin resuscitating a baby who
				is not breathing well, after you have suctioned its mouth and then
				its nose.</li>
			<li>Check that the baby is alive (listen for an apical
				heartbeat); that the heart rate is above 60 beats/minute (begin
				heart massage <i>before</i> resuscitation if the heart rate is less
				than 60 beats/minute); and that the baby is not stained with
				meconium, which must be suctioned out <i>before</i> resuscitation
				can begin.
			</li>
			<li>Position the baby with its neck extended to open the
				airways; place a correctly fitting ventilation mask over the baby's
				mouth and nose, and begin ventilating at a rate of about 40 breaths
				per minute.</li>
			<li>Watch for signs of improvement: e.g. pinkish colour,
				movement, ability to breathe unaided, etc. Refer urgently if this
				has not been achieved after 30 minutes of ventilation.</li>
			<li>Remember to conduct all the activities of essential newborn
				care, including cord care, giving a vitamin K injection and
				tetracycline eye ointment, establishing early and exclusive
				breastfeeding, and ensuring that anti-HIV medication is given to
				prevent mother-to-child-transmission.</li>
