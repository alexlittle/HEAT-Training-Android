					In previous study sessions of this module, you have been introduced
					to the definitions, signs, symptoms and stages of normal labour,
					and about the 'normal' <i>vertex</i> presentation of the
					fetus during delivery. In this study session, you will learn about
					the most common abnormal presentations (breech, shoulder, face or
					brow), their diagnostic criteria and the required actions you need
					to take to prevent complications developing during labour. Taking
					prompt action may save the life of the mother and her baby if the
					delivery becomes obstructed because the baby is in an abnormal
					presentation. We will also tell you about twin births and the
					complications that may result if the two babies become
					'locked' together, preventing either of them from being
					born.
