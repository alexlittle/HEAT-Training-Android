		<p>In Study Session 8, you learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>During early pregnancy, babies are naturally in the breech
				position, but in 95% of cases they spontaneously reverse into the
				vertex presentation before labour begins.</li>
			<li>Malpresentation or malposition of the fetus at full term
				increases the risk of obstructed labour and other birth
				complications.</li>
			<li>Common causes of malpresentations/malpositions include:
				excess amniotic fluid, abnormal shape and size of the pelvis;
				uterine tumour; placenta praevia; slackness of uterine muscles
				(after many previous pregnancies); or multiple pregnancy.</li>
			<li>Common complications include: premature rupture of
				membranes, premature labour, prolonged/obstructed labour; ruptured
				uterus; postpartum haemorrhage; fetal and maternal distress which
				may lead to death.</li>
			<li>Vertex malposition is when the fetal head is in the
				occipito-posterior position - i.e. the back of the fetal skull is
				towards the mother's back instead of pointing towards the front of
				the mother's pelvis. 90% of vertex malpositions rotate and deliver
				normally.</li>
			<li>Breech presentation (complete, frank or footling) is when
				the baby's buttocks present during labour. It occurs in 3â€“4% of
				labours after 34 weeks of pregnancy and may lead to obstructed
				labour,' cord prolapse, hypoxia, premature separation of the
				placenta, birth injury to the baby or to the birth canal.</li>
			<li>Face presentation is when the fetal head is bent so far
				backwards that the face presents during labour. It occurs in about 1
				in 500 full term labours. 'Chin posterior' face presentations
				usually rotate spontaneously to the 'chin anterior' position and
				deliver normally. If rotation does not occur, a caesarean delivery
				is likely to be necessary.</li>
			<li>Brow presentation is when the baby's forehead is the
				presenting part. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 full term labours and
				is difficult to detect before the onset of labour. Caesarean
				delivery is likely to be necessary.</li>
			<li>Shoulder presentation occurs when the fetal lie during
				labour is transverse. Once labour is well progressed, vaginal
				examination may feel the baby's ribs, and an arm may sometimes
				prolapse. Caesarean delivery is always required unless a doctor or
				midwife can turn the baby head-down.</li>
			<li>Multiple pregnancies are always at high risk of
				malpresentation. Mothers need greater antenatal care, and twins are
				more prone to complications associated with low birth weight and
				prematurity.</li>
			<li>Any presentation other than vertex after 34 weeks of
				gestation is considered as high risk to the mother and to her baby.
				<i>Do not attempt to turn a malpresenting or malpositioned baby!
			</i>Refer the mother for emergency obstetric care.
