		<p>Obstructed labour is a totally preventable labour
					complication. One of your major roles as a skilled birth attendant
					is to prevent the occurrence of obstructed labour in women in your
					community. It is highly prevalent in the rural areas of Ethiopia,
					particularly among women who are in labour at home for a long time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obstructed labour is associated with a high <b>perinatal
						mortality and morbidity</b> (fetal and newborn deaths, and disease and
					disability occurring around the time of the birth). It contributes
					to 22% of the maternal mortality in Ethiopia. This shocking figure
					is certainly an underestimation of the problem, because deaths due
					to obstructed labour are often classified under other complications
					(such as sepsis, postpartum haemorrhage or ruptured uterus).
				</p>
				<p>In this session, you will learn how to identify the clinical
					signs of prolonged and obstructed labours and determine the best
					management. Delayed management of obstructed labour often causes
					fistula in surviving women, which if not treated, may make them
					outcasts from their community for the rest of their lives.</p>
