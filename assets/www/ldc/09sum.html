		<p>In Study Session 9 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Obstructed labour is failure of descent of the fetus through
				the birth canal (pelvis) because there is an impossible barrier
				(obstruction) preventing its descent in spite of strong uterine
				contractions.</li>
			<li>Causes of obstructed labour are cephalopelvic disproportion
				(CPD), abnormal presentations, fetal abnormalities and abnormalities
				of the maternal reproductive tract.</li>
			<li>Causes of prolonged labour are abnormality in one or more of
				the three 'Ps': power, passenger and passage.</li>
			<li>The best diagnostic tool for you to identify prolonged
				labour is the partograph.</li>
			<li>The clinical features of obstructed labour include mother
				stay in labour for more than 12 hours, exhausted and unable to
				support herself, deranged vital signs, dehydrated, Bandl's ring
				formation in the abdomen, bladder full above the symphysispubis, big
				caput and big moulding, may be edematous vaginal opening.</li>
			<li>Common maternal complications of obstructed labour include
				sepsis, paralytic ileus, postpartum haemorrhage, fistula formation.</li>
			<li>Common fetal complications of obstructed labour are severe
				asphyxia, neonatal sepsis and death.</li>
			<li>Early referral can save the life of the woman and the baby
				in case of obstructed labour.</li>
