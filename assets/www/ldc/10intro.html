			<b>Ruptured uterus</b> is a tearing or bursting of the uterus due to
			the pressure exerted by an obstructed labour. Uterine rupture is very
			prevalent in developing countries like Ethiopia, where around 94% of
			deliveries occur at home with no skilled health professional
			attending the labour. When labour ends with a ruptured uterus, the
			usual consequences for the woman (if she survives), are losing her
			baby and losing her uterus.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost all cases of uterine rupture occur among <i>multiparous</i>
			women, who have previously given birth at least once after their baby
			reached 28 weeks of gestation. You will find out why this is so later
			in this study session. Uterine rupture can also occur among women
			with a scarred uterus, if the scar tissue tears open. However, in
			Ethiopia and other developing countries, almost all cases of uterine
			rupture occur in women with an unscarred uterus whose labour became
			obstructed when noone was present to intervene. In this study session
			you will learn about the risk factors and clinical features of
			ruptured uterus, its consequences for the mother and the baby, and
			how to institute life-saving interventions.
