		<p>In Study Session 10 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In Ethiopia, uterine rupture most often occurs because of
				neglected obstructed labour. With early intervention and appropriate
				care, uterine rupture is almost entirely preventable.</li>
			<li>More cases of uterine rupture occur among multiparous women
				than among primiparous women. One reason is that in primiparous
				woman uterine intertia acts to prevent contractions remaining
				forceful and frequent for such a long time that uterine rupture
				occurs.</li>
			<li>Uterine inertia in primiparous women has other risks:
				because the fetal head stays in the pelvis for a long time there is
				increased risk of fetal hypoxia, fistula formation, retention of
				urine and infection of the bladder.</li>
			<li>The main predisposing factor for uterine rupture is an
				obstructed labour, which may be due to cephalopelvic disproportion,
				malpresentation/malposition of the fetus, multiple pregnancy, a
				uterine tumour, or scarring. Other factors increasing the risk of
				rupture include a previously repaired fistula, injudicious use of
				uterotonic drugs, and abdominal massage during labour by traditional
				healers.</li>
			<li>The clinical features of imminent uterine rupture are
				persistent uterine contractions of 60â€“90 seconds duration or longer,
				occurring more than 5 times in every 10 minutes, fetal heartbeat
				derangement (persistently above 160 beats/minute or below 120
				beats/minute), Bandl's ring formation, abdominal tenderness, and
				maybe vaginal bleeding.</li>
			<li>The key sign that a uterus has ruptured is that contractions
				stop completely.</li>
			<li>Other signs of a ruptured uterus may include abdominal
				tenderness, easily palpable fetal parts, abdominal distension,
				absence of fetal kick and absence of fetal heartbeat.</li>
			<li>The clinical condition of a woman with a ruptured uterus
				depends on the extent of blood loss, duration of rupture and
				presence of established infection.</li>
			<li>Common complications of uterine rupture are fetal death,
				maternal death, infection and haemorrhagic and/or septic shock,
				peritonitis, acute kidney failure, and surgical removal of the
				uterus</li>
			<li>Some reasons why so many Ethiopian women die of a ruptured
				uterus are: reluctance to seek skilled help at birth and then delay
				in seeking medical help following a rupture; further delay in
				getting treatment because of distance to a health facility; or lack
				of equipment and appropriately trained personnel when the woman
				arrives for emergency care.</li>
