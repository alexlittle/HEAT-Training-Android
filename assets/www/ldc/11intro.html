			Worldwide, every year, an estimated 127,000 women die as a result of
			blood loss following labour and delivery. It is the world's leading
			cause of maternal mortality, accounting for a quarter of all maternal
			deaths. In total there are 14 million cases of haemorrhage occurring
			every year in association with pregnancy and childbirth, the majority
			of which are because failure of the uterus to contract properly after
			delivery of the placenta results in heavy bleeding or <b>postpartum
				haemorrhage</b>. In Study Session 6 you learned about the management of
			the third stage of labour, which begins with delivery of the baby and
			ends with delivery of the placenta and fetal membranes.

			In this study session, you will learn about postpartum haemorrhage
			(PPH) and its management. PPH is one of the most alarming and serious
			emergencies in childbirth and your rapid actions can save many lives.
			Do not forget that <b>antepartum haemorrhage</b> (excessive bleeding
			<i>before</i> labour begins) can also threaten the life of the mother
			and fetus. You learned about early and late pregnancy bleeding in
			Study Sessions 20 and 21 of the <i>Antenatal Care</i> Module.
