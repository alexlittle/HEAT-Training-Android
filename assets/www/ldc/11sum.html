		<p>In Study Session 11, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the leading causes of
				maternal death in developing countries. It is difficult to predict
				which women will develop PPH, so you should be prepared to deal with
				it at every birth.</li>
			<li>PPH can be prevented to a great extent by skilled care
				during pregnancy, labour and delivery, and the immediate postpartum
				period.</li>
			<li>During antenatal care, all pregnant women should receive
				advice about diet and malaria prevention, treatment for hookworm,
				and iron/folate supplements to prevent anaemia, which is a risk
				factor for PPH.</li>
			<li>Refer early if labour is prolonged and control the delivery
				of the baby's head during second stage to prevent traumatic PPH.</li>
			<li>After delivery of the baby, give misoprostol or oxytocin to
				prevent atonic PPH, and massage the uterus after delivery of the
				placenta.</li>
			<li>If PPH develops, identify the cause of the bleeding. If due
				to atonic uterus (with or without with retained placenta), massage
				the uterus using two-handed pressure, empty the bladder (using a
				catheter if necessary), secure an IV fluid infusion, and administer
				either a second dose of oxytocin 10 IU by intramuscular
				injection, or a second dose of misoprostol 400 &#xB5;g
				rectally or by putting the tablets under her tongue.</li>
			<li>If PPH is due to trauma, apply firm pressure to the source
				of the bleeding with a sterile pad for 10 minutes. If bleeding
				continues, reapply the pressure and refer the woman to a health
				facility where the tear can be repaired.</li>
			<li>When you need to arrange referral to a health facility, stay
				with the mother, checking her vital signs, maintaining uterine
				pressure and giving her warmth and emotional support.</li>
