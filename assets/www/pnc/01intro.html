			<b>Postnatal </b><b>care </b>(<b>PNC</b>)<b> </b>is the care given to
			the mother and her newborn baby immediately after the birth and for
			the first six weeks of life (Figure 1.1). This period marks the
			establishment of a new phase of family life for women and their
			partners and the beginning of the lifelong health record for newborn
			babies (or <b>neonates</b><b> - </b>a term often used by doctors,
			nurses and midwives).

		<p>Although for most women and babies, the postnatal period is
			uncomplicated, effective postnatal care (PNC) is also about
			recognising any deviation from expected recovery after birth, and
			evaluating and intervening appropriately in a timely fashion. It is
			of major concern that less than 6% of women in Ethiopia give birth in
			health facilities and not more than 10% receive any postnatal care
			within two days of delivery. Your role as a Health Extension
			Practitioner is therefore vitally important in improving this
			situation, identifying danger signs and reducing the adverse outcomes
			for mothers and newborns.</p>
		<p>
			In Ethiopia, as in all countries, the postnatal period is often
			marked by specific cultural practices. Understanding the beliefs and
			cultural practices in your community is fundamental in ensuring
			appropriate postnatal care. In this first study session, you will
			learn why care in the postnatal period is so important, and about the
			need for community participation and involvement for optimum PNC. We
			briefly summarise some methods of community mobilisation, and how to
			establish partnerships with the key <i>gate</i><i>keepers</i><b>
			</b>who can help you look after new mothers and their babies.
