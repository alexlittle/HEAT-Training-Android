					In Study Session 1 you have learned that:<b> </b>
				</p>
				<ol >
					<li>The maternal mortality ratio and neonatal mortality rate
						in Ethiopia are among the highest in the world.</li>
					<li>Around 45-50% of mothers and newborns die in the first 24
						hours after the birth, and 65-75% of maternal and newborn deaths
						occur in the first week.</li>
					<li>Effective postnatal care within six hours of the birth,
						and after two days, six days and six weeks could significantly
						reduce maternal and neonatal mortality.</li>
					<li>The most common causes of postnatal maternal death include
						haemorrhage, eclampsia, infection and ruptured uterus.</li>
					<li>The most important causes of neonatal death are infection,
						birth asphyxia, prematurity and low birth weight.</li>
					<li>The postnatal period is a time of rapid physiological
						adjustment for the mother to the non-pregnant state, and for the
						newborn adapting to life outside the uterus.</li>
					<li>Danger signs for the mother in the postnatal period
						include the uterus not well contracted, active vaginal bleeding
						and shock.</li>
					<li>Danger signs for the newborn include jaundice, respiratory
						distress, fever and other signs of infection, hypothermia,
						persistent vomiting, and bleeding from the umbilical stump or
						anus.</li>
					<li>Before launching a PNC service, you should conduct
						awareness creation and sensitisation sessions to ensure full
						community participation, and involve community leaders,
						traditional birth attendants and healers; also carry out home
						visits to teach parents and caregivers and distribute information,
						education and communication materials.</li>
