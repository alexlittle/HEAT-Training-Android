			In this study session you will learn about the normal postnatal
			changes that occur to women during the six weeks after childbirth.
			The postnatal period is also known by doctors, nurses and midwives as
			the <b>puerperium</b>. It includes the normal processes of physical
			and psychological adjustments during this period. Do you remember the
			physiological changes in pregnancy from the <i>Antenatal Care</i>
			Module, Study Session 3? Here we focus in detail on the normal
			adjustments during the puerperium, in particular the changes that
			occur in the reproductive system and in other body systems.
		</p>

		<p>Puerperium is pronounced 'poo-ayre-peer-ee-um'.</p>

		<p>Some women in your postnatal care may not understand all of the
			normal changes which they experience after childbirth. They may
			become alarmed about changes that are perfectly normal, or ignore
			symptoms that are really danger signs. Some women find mothering a
			new baby very easy and natural; for others the mothering role may be
			difficult. As a Health Extension Practitioner working in the
			community, you have a unique opportunity to assist mothers and their
			families to cope with the adjustments during the postnatal period.</p>
