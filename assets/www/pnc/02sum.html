		<p>In Study Session 2, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The period of six weeks after childbirth is called the
				puerperium; this is when the physiological changes to the mother's
				body that occurred in pregnancy revert back to normal. The uterus,
				cervix, vagina and vulva reduce in size and the excess fluids
				retained during pregnancy are quickly eliminated in the mother's
				urine.</li>
			<li>Postnatal mothers have a normal reddish, watery vaginal
				discharge after childbirth called lochia, which gradually reduces
				during the puerperium and changes colour to pale yellow.</li>
			<li>The changes to the breasts that prepare them for
				breastfeeding occur throughout pregnancy; production of colostrum
				begins soon after the birth, followed at about three days by breast
				engorgement and production of true milk.</li>
			<li>The colostrum released by the breasts during the first two
				to three days after delivery is rich in nutrients and maternal
				antibodies; it should always be fed to the newborn.</li>
			<li>Breastfeeding should begin within the first hour after
				childbirth and continued exclusively, and on demand by the baby, for
				the first six months.</li>
			<li>Mothers (and often fathers) need support to adjust to the
				demands of caring for a new baby, including support for beginning
				breastfeeding and keeping the baby warm and clean. Mothers need time
				for rest and recovery before resuming normal activities.</li>
			<li>The various options for postnatal family planning should be
				discussed with both parents.</li>
