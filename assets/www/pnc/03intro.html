			As you learned in Study Session 2, the course of the puerperium goes
			smoothly in most women. The <b>puerperium</b> is the period of about
			six weeks after the birth, in which physiological adjustment to the
			non-pregnant state occurs. However, sometimes women will develop
			health problems which should come to your attention. You may handle
			some of these problems yourself, but you will need to refer others
			for further assessment and treatment at a hospital or health centre.
			Infections are among the most prominent puerperal complications and
			are a major cause of maternal mortality in Ethiopia. Fever is the
			main symptom and antibiotics are the main treatment. Prevention of
			infection by ensuring cleanliness and hygiene at delivery is
			obviously the best course of action.
		</p>

		<p>The term 'postpartum' means 'after the birth and related to
			it'.</p>

		<p>The other common complications include late postpartum
			haemorrhage (PPH), urinary tract infections, hypertension and mental
			health problems. In this study session, you will learn about the
			common abnormalities that can occur in the course of the puerperium,
			and one uncommon but life-threatening complication â€“ deep vein
			thrombosis (a blood clot inside the veins that blocks the blood
			flow).</p>
