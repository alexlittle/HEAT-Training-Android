		<p>In Study Session 3, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Although the most critical period to develop postpartum
				haemorrhage is in the third and fourth stages of labour, you should
				continue being vigilant during the puerperium and counsel the mother
				to report any active vaginal bleeding.</li>
			<li>The commonest causes of late PPH are endometritis, poor
				uterine contraction, retained placenta and sloughing of the
				placental bed.</li>
			<li>Any amount of active vaginal bleeding after 24 hours of
				delivery should be taken as a serious complication and the woman
				should be referred.</li>
			<li>The commonest types of puerperal infection are endometritis,
				mastitis, urinary tract infection and wound infection, all of which
				are usually accompanied by fever.</li>
			<li>Risk factors for postnatal endometritis are prolonged
				labour, prolonged PROM, repeated vaginal examination, pre-existing
				lower reproductive tract infection, retained placenta, and traumatic
				delivery including caesarean section or forceps.</li>
			<li>In a woman who develops puerperal mastitis, breastfeeding is
				encouraged.</li>
			<li>Postpartum hypertension characterised by high blood
				pressure, oedema, visual disturbances and (in eclampsia)
				convulsions, can develop in a woman who had normal blood pressure
				and was symptom-free during pregnancy, labour and delivery.</li>
			<li>Deep vein thrombosis is characterised by a painful and
				swollen leg, and more commonly occurs in women who remain in bed for
				several days after the birth.</li>
			<li>Some women may develop mental health problems, the commonest
				of which is short-term, mild postpartum blues. Some women may
				develop serious depression which needs care and treatment at a
				higher level facility.</li>
