			You are aware of these considerations from the Modules on <i>Antenatal
				Care</i> and <i>Labour and Delivery Care.</i>
		</p>

		<p>In the majority of pregnancies prior to delivery, you will have
			already started communicating and discussing postnatal care with the
			mother and other family members. It is during these antenatal visits
			that you will be able to collect information about the mother, the
			family and their social conditions, and you will also be able to give
			them your address and tell them how they can contact you whenever
			they need your assistance. During the pregnancy you will also have
			encouraged all mothers to deliver their baby in the Health Post or
			higher health facility if possible, but in rural Ethiopia over 94% of
			women will deliver at home. In those cases, you will have advised the
			family members to call you immediately when labour starts.</p>

		<p>If you are present at the delivery, you already know that you
			should stay with the mother for at least the first six hours after
			the birth. However if she gave birth without you, visit her as soon
			as possible, ideally within a few hours and no later than the first
			day. Before you go to the mother for the first postnatal visit,
			prepare the equipment and drugs that are essential to provide
			effective postnatal care. In this study session, you will learn about
			the equipment, the schedule and aims of the postnatal visits, the
			detailed steps of necessary preparation before you go, and what you
			should do when you reach the new motherâ€™s home.</p>
