			<li>The major barriers to facility-based PNC are social and
				cultural, physical, geographic, quality and financial barriers. The
				home visit-based approach is the one that addresses all these
				barriers most effectively in rural communities.</li>
			<li>The schedule of PNC home visits for uncomplicated mothers
				and newborns is: first visit within 24 hours of the birth, and visit
				again on day three and day seven, and during the sixth week.</li>
			<li>For all sick mothers and newborns, HIV-positive mothers,
				preterm and low birth weight babies, you should also visit on day
				five and day ten.</li>
			<li>When you conduct a home visit for PNC, always wear simple
				but very clean clothes, and pay attention to your personal hygiene.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to pack the essential equipment and drugs
				necessary to provide PNC.</li>
			<li>Be respectful to everyone in the home when you visit; act
				confidently and communicate clearly using local language and
				terminologies.</li>
			<li>Use the cards and forms provided to ensure that you cover
				all aspects of screening and counselling, especially detecting
				danger signs in the mother and newborn.</li>
			<li>When you counsel mothers, you should ask and listen, praise
				positive behaviours, limit advice to what she needs to know at each
				visit, and check that she has understood your messages.</li>
