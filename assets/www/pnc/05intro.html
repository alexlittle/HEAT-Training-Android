<p>Postnatal care (PNC) for the mother should respond to her
					special needs, starting within an hour after the delivery of the
					placenta and extending through the following six weeks. The care
					includes the prevention, early detection and treatment of
					complications, and the provision of counselling on breastfeeding,
					birth spacing, immunization and maternal nutrition. To standardise
					the PNC service, you are advised to use the screening, counselling
					and postnatal care cards. These cards ensure that you have covered
					all the essential steps in every home visit.</p>
				<p>In this study session we are going to focus primarily on the
					routine checks you need to do to make sure the mother is recovering
					well after the birth, both physically and emotionally. We will also
					advise you on how you should counsel her on taking care of her
					health and recovery, maintaining her personal hygiene to reduce the
					risk of infection, and what she should eat â€“ especially if she is
					breastfeeding.</p>
