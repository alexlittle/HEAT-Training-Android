		<p>In Study Session 5 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The focus for postnatal maternal care is on early
				identification of the general danger signs through regular checks on
				the mother's temperature, pulse and blood pressure, physical
				examination for contraction of the uterus, bleeding, damage to the
				genital area, infection or hypertensive disorders, followed by
				prompt referral.</li>
			<li>The core care that you need to provide to the postnatal
				mother includes measuring her vital signs at every visit, washing
				her genital area and checking for tears, blood clots, cervical
				prolapse and bleeding, helping her to urinate, eat and drink, and
				giving her micronutrient supplementation (vitamin A, iron and folic
				acid).</li>
			<li>Counselling the mother, her partner and other family members
				during the postnatal period focuses on empowering them to recognise
				the general danger symptoms and seek appropriate care quickly,
				improve her nutrition to support breastfeeding and recovery, and
				give her emotional support and help with daily living.</li>
			<li>Seclusion of mothers and babies in the postnatal period is
				not good for the mother's mental health and may leave her at risk of
				neglect, feeling isolated and depressed, and danger signs may be
				missed if no-one is with her.</li>
