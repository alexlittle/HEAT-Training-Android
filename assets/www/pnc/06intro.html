		<p>In this study session, we return to the general danger signs
			that the newborn may be at risk, which were already outlined briefly
			in Study Session 1. This time we focus on assessment and
			classification of the danger signs in much more detail, and describe
			the actions that you need to take to prevent and treat common
			neonatal problems, particularly infections of the respiratory system,
			eyes and cord stump, and life-threatening conditions such as jaundice
			and tetanus. Involving the mother in this process is a key part of
			postnatal care. Her vigilance and willingness to contact you if she
			is concerned about her baby’s condition can save her baby’s life.</p>
