		<p>In Study Session 6 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol >
			<li>A key part of every postnatal visit is to assess the newborn
				for general danger signs, including: not feeding, convulsions,
				lethargy or abnormal body movements, fast breathing with chest
				in-drawing, jaundice, skin lesions including umbilical infection,
				eye discharge and neonatal tetanus.</li>
			<li>Routine preparations before assessing the newborn are to
				wash your hands thoroughly and ask the mother to begin
				breastfeeding, so you can assess how well the baby feeds, and also
				to keep the baby calm during your assessment.</li>
			<li>Asking the mother about her newborn baby's condition is an
				important source of information in making your assessment.</li>
			<li>Make sure that you explain to her the ways in which she can
				help to prevent infection in her newborn, including hand washing,
				keeping the baby clean and the cord stump clean and dry, and
				avoiding overcrowding or unhygienic conditions where they are
				living.</li>
			<li>According to the 'Assess and Classify Chart' (Table
				6.1), the possible classifications are: Possible serious infection,
				possible infection or jaundice, or a normal baby. Classification
				helps you to make the proper decision about what action to take.</li>
