<p>During the postnatal period, counselling the mother of a
					normal healthy newborn baby focuses on many issues, including those
					already covered in earlier study sessions, such as infection
					prevention, nutrition for the mother, and family planning. In this
					study session, we return in detail to two topics that have been
					touched on previously: how to begin and maintain optimum
					breastfeeding, and how to keep the baby warm using the 'warm
					chain principle'. The first part of this study session is about
					feeding the normal weight, healthy, full-term baby. Then we will
					look at the special counselling that HIV-positive mothers need
					about feeding babies who are full term and normal weight. Study
					Session 8 will cover the special care needed to feed and maintain
					the body temperature of preterm or low birth weight babies.</p>
