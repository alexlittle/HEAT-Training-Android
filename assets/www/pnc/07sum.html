		<p>In Study Session 7 you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have an important role in the postnatal period in
				counselling the mother on breastfeeding and how to keep the baby
				warm.</li>
			<li>You should teach the mother about the different positions
				for optimum breastfeeding and the signs of good attachment.</li>
			<li>There are many benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding for
				the mother and her newborn, compared to formula milk, including
				reduced risk of gastrointestinal infection in the baby, and faster
				contraction of the uterus.</li>
			<li>HIV-positive mothers should be counselled to avoid
				breastfeeding completely if they can provide replacement feeding
				with formula milk which fulfils the AFASS criteria: acceptable,
				feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe.</li>
			<li>Newborns can lose heat rapidly through conduction,
				convection, evaporation and radiation; the warm chain principle
				tells you how to keep the baby warm at all times.</li>
