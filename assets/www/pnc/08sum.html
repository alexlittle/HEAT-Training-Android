		<p>In Study Session 8, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preterm and low birth weight babies are particularly
				vulnerable to die of infections, breathing problems and hypothermia
				because of their immaturity.</li>
			<li>It is important to classify preterm and low birth weight
				newborns immediately after birth according to their gestational age
				and their birth weight, and refer those who are very preterm or very
				low birth weight.</li>
			<li>You can effectively counsel the mother on breastfeeding the
				preterm and low birth weight baby, including feeding every two
				hours, and how to express breast milk and cup feed if the baby is
				not yet developed enough to suckle effectively.</li>
			<li>You can teach the mother and her family how to use kangaroo
				mother care (KMC) and explain the advantages to them, which include
				increased breastfeeding, better control of the baby's body
				temperature, early weight gain, better respiration and lower
				infection rates.</li>
			<li>KMC continues day and night until the preterm baby reaches
				40 weeks of gestational age and/or the low birth weight baby reaches
				at least 1,800 gm. Mothers will need extra support to cope with the
				demands of KMC.</li>
