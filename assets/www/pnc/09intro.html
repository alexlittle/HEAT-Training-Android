			As you reach the end of this Module, you will have to come to realise
			just how vital your role is in providing effective postnatal care.
			Health Extension Practitioners (HEPs) like you not only promote the
			health of mothers and newborn babies in your community, but you save
			lives too. The postnatal care you provide is part of the <b>continuum
				of maternal and child health care</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The continuum of care begins even before the women in your community
			become pregnant; it then continues through the antenatal care you
			give them during their pregnancy and the skill and support you bring
			to their labour and delivery. It merges seamlessly into your role in
			the postnatal period. Of course the continuum does not stop there:
			later you will study the Module on the <i>Integrated Management
				of Newborn and Childhood </i><i>Illness</i>, which teaches you how to
			preserve and protect the health of infants and older children. So you
			can see this continuum as an ongoing process of giving support at all
			stages of from birth through to childhood, including support to their
			mothers.
