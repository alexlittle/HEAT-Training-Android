		<p>In Study Session 9, you have learned that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Referral is a two-way street. Referrals are from the health
				workers in the community to the higher-level health facility, and
				also the other way round. The two directions are highly
				interdependent and equally relevant for the overall success of
				postnatal care.</li>
			<li>The referral link should involve feedback in both directions
				about what has already happened to the patient (diagnosis, treatment
				and other health management issues), as well as how the patient
				should be followed up and supported in the future.</li>
			<li>Just telling people to go to the health facility or writing
				a referral note is a small part of the referral process, and is
				unlikely to be effective without careful advance preparation and
				follow up.</li>
			<li>What really matters is your counselling skill in persuading
				and convincing the family on the importance of the referral, and
				your role working in the community to alleviate the barriers that
				can prevent mothers and newborns from reaching the health facility
				in good time.</li>
			<li>Establishing an effective link and effective coordination
				between all members of maternal and newborn health services is the
				key to achieving the goal of a continuum of care. This starts from
				the household, involves you working in the community, and connects
				all the way up to the higher-level health facilities and advanced
				treatment centres, before patients return back to your care and
				their family in the community.</li>
